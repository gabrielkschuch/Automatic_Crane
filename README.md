# Automatic_Crane

This project is a coloboration between the students of Industrial Automation of the IFSUL, Gabriel Schuch and Ã‰rick Lindemann.

# The objective

The objective of the project is to control a Crane using the Arduino with Stepper motors

# Materials used

1- An ULN2803 driver to control the stepper motors;
2- An ULN2003 driver to control the stepper motor;
3- An Arduino Uno;

# Improvements

One of the biggest improvemnts that we want to do is to use a ethernet module in the arduino Uno to control the crane by a website that we created.
